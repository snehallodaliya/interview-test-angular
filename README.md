# Rezare Systems / Map of Agriculture Interview Test

This repository is the template for our technical interview test.

This template contains the following:

- .Net 8.0 Web API
- Angular web application (recommend using node version 16.x or 18.x as this is Angular 16)

Each of the above projects are stubbed out and provides some extremely basic functionality.
The currently implemented features are as follows:

- List of students on the home page
- API endpoint to return the full list of students

We ask that you spend as much of the allotted time to do this test as you can; and start by taking a Fork of this repository.
